1. What is the complexity of your implementation?
Explain this by describing which data structures you used and how you used them to implement network flow.

The data structures I used to represent my network flow is a vector of maps where each index of the vector represents a vertex and then the pairs at 
each index represent the adjacent vertices to the current vertex (key) and the respective weight between vertices (values).

The time complexity of my implementation is O(W(V+E)), where W represents the length of the word, V represents the number of vertices, and E represents 
the number of edges. The reason why is O(W(V+E)) is because in the worst case scenario we are going to execute bfs() F number of times, where F represents 
the maximum flow, and the maximum flow is bounded by the number of nodes to the sink which is equal to the length of the word.
